## What is Sparktify?
A simple Windows system tray application that automatically lowers the volume of Spotify when audio starts playing from a different source.

The application is currently in beta. Therefore, there may be bugs. If you encounter a bug, please feel free to open a new issue.

## Features
You can find the settings.ini file in the Documents section. Here you can adjust how much you want to reduce the sound level.
